799="Hmm. Oh! Don't mind me. Just passing the time by waiting for eternity."
800="Oh, blast it all. There's a leak in the roof again. I swear, I don't know what I'm paying these idlers for. These old bones can't take one more maintenance job."
801="You know Gabriel? That guy's a bit too cocky for my liking if you ask me. Always running around, acting like he owns the place. He has a lot to learn if he's ever gonna make something of himself."
802="Next time you're up at Raphael's club, you tell him to turn that racket down! Our guests won't be able to sleep with all that noise! If only we had some..."
803="Uriel is a scary one. She'll burn anything that moves in the name of god. If ya ask me, the only enemies are the ones in her head."
804="Have you ever been to Ramiel's garden? It's nice I suppose. Personally I've never been a fan of modern architecture."
805="You ever heard of an angel named Azrael? I've never met him personally, just heard rumors. Hell, just what I've heard is enough to give me the creeps! They say he commands a mighty angel! Wouldn't like to meet him in a dark alley..."
806="Pray you never get on Akrasiel's bad side. That guy will do anything to hunt down criminals. All in the name of Justice, if there ever was such a thing."
807="I haven't seen Michael in ages! I hear he hangs out in the far corner of heaven. Yessir, there's a lot of trouble that goes on there. Drinking, fighting, all that nonsense. A bit too extreme for my tastes."
808="Which way I fly is hell;#myself am hell;#And in the lowest deep a lower deep,#Still threatening to devour me, opens wide,#To which the hell I suffer seems a heaven."
858="*Wakes up from nap*"
859="Seems like the door requires two keys to be opened"
860="Another classic esoteric door. Heaven is full of this crap."
861="The data fragments are humming. They must be the keys to this door."
862="Can't open this door without a special index. Must be around here somewhere."
863="I should probably come back here when I've defeated all the Archangels."
